# java-backend-prep
This is an old college project (Q1-2021) that I'm proud of my team's work.

We we're assigned by 4 different classes to do a big project, a PREP, which stands for "Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares" in Spanish, which translates to "Preliminary Electoral Results Program" in English.

We we're a team of 4, 2 colleagues on the front-end, 1 colleague on the database, and I, working with the back-end, all of which was developed using Java 8, with Servlets and HTTP Request, with an MVC pattern, Glassfish, Apache Tomcat and NetBeans IDE.
