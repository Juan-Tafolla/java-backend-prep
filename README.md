# Java-Backend-PREP
This project dates back to my college days (Q1-2021), and it's one I'm particularly proud of due to the teamwork involved.

We were assigned by four different classes to complete a significant project, a PREP, which stands for "Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares" in Spanish, translating to "Preliminary Electoral Results Program" in English.

Our team consisted of four members: two colleagues were responsible for the front-end, one managed the database, and I was tasked with the back-end. The project was developed using Java 8, Servlets, and HTTP Requests, adhering to an MVC pattern. We utilized Glassfish and Apache Tomcat servers with the NetBeans IDE for development.
